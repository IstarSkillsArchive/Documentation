WINDOWS
---------------

1) Zip the talentify working directory from your computer

2) Use WinSCP and upload the zip file

3) Logout from WinSCP

4) Use Putty to start a remote session with talentify

5) Login with your username/password

6) Use sudo su - to login with root permissions

7) Enter password for sudo

8) 
Copy the uploaded zip file from your home directory to /root/

cp /home/<yourhomedirname>/<talentify.zip> /root/

9) Get the pid (process id) of the talentify web app

ps ax | grep node

10) Kill the talentify web app

kill -9 <node-process-id>

11) Any content uploaded to talentify will be saved under /root/lepo-new/uploads.

It's always good to maintain a backup of all the uploaded files in a separate directory /root/uploads

When the new build is being sent, we need to retain the /uploads directory.

Before deleting the 'lepo-new' (talentify working directory), save a copy of the /uploads directory

cp -r lepo-new/uploads /root/

12) Delete the talentify working directory

rm -rf lepo-new

13) Unzip the newly uploaded talentify zip file

unzip <talentify.zip> 

14) Remove the zip file

rm <talentify.zip>

15) Copy the /uploads directory into talentify working directory

cp -r /uploads lepo-new/

16) cd (change dir) to lepo-new

cd lepo-new

17) nvm use v0.10.26

//to esure the right node version is being used

18) nohup node app &

//run talentify as a background process
