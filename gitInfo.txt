Create a github account

Login as sreeram, add any new (private) repository you want to create 

Go to the team view, add members to this newly created repository

Open git bash locally

Change to the local directory you wish to push onto this new (or existing) repository

Initialize git in this local directory (first time only)
>> git init

Add files to this folder (if the directory is empty)

You need to select what gets pushed onto the github repo

	a) To add a single (or a particular file) 
	>> git add <fileName>

	b) To add the whole directory
	>> git add .

At any point, you can check the status of your newly added files
>> git status

At any point, you can get a log of all the commits
>> git log

After a file (or files) is (have been) added, you need to commit with a message
>> git commit -m "some message"

If a repository has been newly created, then we need to connect the local directory with this new repository
	>> git remote add <name> <github repository url>
	Eg for <name>: origin
	Eg for <github repository url>: https://github.com/ISTARSkills/Documentation.git

At any point, you can check the git repositories associated with this local directory
>>git remote -v

Once the local files have been committed, it's now time to push them to github
	>> git push <name> master
	where <name> refers to the same name used in "git remote add <name> <github repository url>" command
	Enter your github username and password when prompted

The files are now on github
